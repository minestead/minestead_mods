based on mod tmw_slimes by Piezo_

Mod adds blue (ocean) slime, green, yellow, orange, pink and ice slime. Slimes spawned in caves and stain everything around with glowing phlegm.
if you kill a slime, then you will get some coins (currency mod) and dyes (dye mod).
The stone covered with mucus is suitable for growing plants. Of course you need light and water as usual.
