Depends:
Required: digilines (base only) and mesecons (base only)
Only needed for craft recipes: default, mesecons_luacontroller, basic_materials


How to use digilines buttons:
Connect to a digiline (or digimese), right-click, and set a channel and message.
When the button is pressed (right-click), it will send that message on that channel, over digilines.
Note that the settings cannot be changed after setting - you must dig and re-place the button to do so.


How to use digimese:
It conducts digilines signals (like digilines) in all directions (like mese). That's about it, really.


How to use vertical/insulated digilines:
These work exactly like the mesecons equivalents, that is:
Vertical digilines will automatically connect to other vertical digilines directly above or below them, and form "plates" on each end of the stack. Signals can only be conducted into or out of the stack at these "plates".
Insulated digilines conduct like regular digilines, but only into/out of the ends of the "wire".


How to use the digilines player detector:
Set a channel and radius (radius must be a number >0 and <10 - anything invalid will be ignored and "6" used instead).
Every second while a player is within the radius, a table listing the players in range will be sent via digilines on the chosen channel.


How to use the digilines control panel:
Once a channel is set, any messages sent on that channel will be shown on the "LCD". The buttons, when pressed, send the messages "up", "down", "left", "right", "back", and "enter" on the same channel. If the panel is placed in a protected area (all standard protection mods are supported), only the owner of the area (and players with the protection_bypass privilege) can set the channel. There is also a "lock" function in the bottom-right of the "LCD" area. Click the padlock icon to lock/unlock it. If locked, only the owner of the area is allowed to use the buttons. If unlocked, anyone can use the buttons, although channel setting and (for reasons that shuld be obvious) locking/unlocking is still limited to the area owner and players with protection_bypass.


How to use the NIC:
Send a digilines signal with the URL you want to download. The HTTPRequestResult table will be sent back on the same channel.


How to use the camera:
Set the channel, distance, and radius. The camera will search for a node "distance" meters away and up to 10m down.
Every second while a player is within "radius" meters of that point, a table listing the players in range will be sent via digilines on the chosen channel.


How to use the dimmable lights:
After setting the channel, send a number from 0 to 14 to set the light level.


How to use the timer:
Send a number representing a time in seconds, from 0.5 to 3600. When the time expires, the timer will send "done" back on the same channel. If the loop feature is enabled (use the commands "loop_on" and "loop_off" to set this) the timer will automatically be set for the same time again each time it expires.

How to use the junction box:
These are just plain digilines conductors (like digimese) but can skip over one node to another junction box or certain other nodes.
As in, [digiline][junction box][dirt][junction box][digiline] will work to transmit signals "through" the dirt.
